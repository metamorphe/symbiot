#really what is happening is the scheduler is not being made different. 
#its turning commands into sparse representations

#quantizing on the fixed-time chunk is one way of avoiding splitting tasks
#each is a fixed time chunk. <actuation time = WCET> roughly equal for each actuator. 

# we know beforehand that tasks have a low WCET variance, however the commands change at run time, as a result of how objects are being scheduled.
