		<h2> MetaMorphe - Dynamic design for digital fabrication </h2>
		<p class='lead'> 
			An exciting and promising new economy and creative practice has begun to develop around digital fabrication (DF) technologies such as 3D printing. While no doubt a remarkable technology, the creative design tools for developing these digital models remain almost entirely static in nature.
			They, unfortunately, bias designs to favor replication and sameness.

			<em> 
				How will we design and fabricate artifacts that are more dynamic, personal, reusable, adaptable and expressive?
