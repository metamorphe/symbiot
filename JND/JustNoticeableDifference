Intensities of physical stimuli and one's perceptions of those stimuli
JND = minimum change in intensity necessary to affect a noticeable difference in sensation

Ernst Heinrich Weber in the 1820s and 1830s conducted a series of experiments to understand the tactile senses: pain, touch, hearing, sight, etc

differential threshold = JND = the threshold in which a difference is perceived
the magnitude of JND is proportional to the magnitude of the original stimulus

I = intensity
Weber constant k = change in I / I
